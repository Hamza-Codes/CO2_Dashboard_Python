# CO2_Dashboard_Python
Made my first dashboard using Python.

The dashboard is a visual representation of CO2 levels from the 18th century through the 21st century. CO2 levels of all countries are visualised as well the CO2 from different sources have also been visualised in the dashboard.

I have used Panel to make the dashboard.
